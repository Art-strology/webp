            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Insert project Title here is the final project of the course "Information Modeling and Web Technologies", taught by professor Fabio Vitali during the academic year 2023/2024 and part of the master degree program in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at University of Bologna.</p>

            <h2>2. Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Insert project Title here is thought as a useful and engaging platform to support visitors in planning their visit and exploring the museum. </p>
            
            <h3><b>2.1 Exhibition</b></h3>
            <p>The exhibition offers a multidisciplinary experience that blends ancient art, astrology, and symbolism. Its main goal is to explore how different cultures perceived and interpreted the stars by identifying shapes and symbols. We have selected a series of artifacts from four distinct cultures: Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, and Chinese. Each artifact is linked to the symbolism and mythology associated with constellations. The exhibition aims to create a bridge between these cultures, showing how they viewed the stars, how modern constellations were understood in ancient times, and how these ancient representations continue to influence today's conception of constellations.</p>
            
            <h3><b>2.2 Objects</b></h3>
            <p>Nineteen artifacts from different cultures were selected for the exhibition, with careful attention to their symbolic meanings and connections. All artifacts are well representative of the artstyle and traditions of their country of origin,while also being linked to one another through their associations with the stars.The four cultures featured are Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, and Chinese. Each of this cultures were mastars in the art of astrology. Each of these cultures excelled in the art of astrology: the Babylonians created the earliest known horoscope, the Greeks identified many constellations that are still recognized today, and the Egyptians and Chinese are noted for their unique contributions. A significant effort was put into comparing how these cultures interpreted the constellations and what kind of symbols were associated with them.</p>

            <h2>4. Design elements</h2>
            
            <h3><b>4.1 Layout</b></h3>
            <p>...</p>
            <h3><b>4.1.1 Homepage</b></h3>
            <p>...</p>
            <h3><b>4.1.2 Items Page</b></h3>
            <p>This page allows users to explore the four narrative perspectives: <b>Chronological, Geographical, Constellation, and Symbolic</b>. Given the interwoven nature of these narratives, the primary focus during the development of this page was to ensure a smooth navigation while maintaining clarity. The goal is to always make it clear which narrative the user is currently viewing. <br>
              To achieve this, a header section at the top of the page displays the <i>title</i> and an <i>image</i> corresponding to the active narrative. As users switch between narratives, both the title and image dynamically update, providing a clear visual indicator of their current position. <br>
              At the center of the page, users find: <ul>
              <li>The image of the item, its name, and a table containing key information about the object.</li>
              <li>Three of these details (Geography, Constellation, and Symbol) are clickable links, allowing users to switch to the corresponding narrative.</li>
              <li>The item image itself is interactive: clicking on it opens a lightbox, enabling zoom functionality for a closer look at details.</li>
              <li>A button is available to access the museum map, helping users locate where the item is physically displayed.</li> </ul> <br>
            <p>
              The "Object Description" section provides detailed information, covering: <ol>
              <li>The physical characteristics of the object.</li>
              <li>The history and significance of its constellation.</li>
              <li>Its symbolic meaning in mythology. </li></ol></p>
            <p>
              By default, only a general introductory paragraph is displayed, but users can expand the section to read the full content. <br>
              Finally, at the bottom of the page, <b>narrative cards</b> present alternative pathways to the other three narratives linked to the item. These serve as a secondary navigation method, ensuring that users can easily explore different perspectives, even if they do not initially notice the links within the descriptive table.
            </p>
            <h3><b>4.1.3 Collection Page</b></h3>
            <p>...</p>
            <h3><b>4.1.4 Map Page</b></h3>
            <p>...</p>
            <h3><b>4.1.5 Timeline Page</b></h3>
            <p>The website features an interactive timeline designed to provide a <b>chronological overview</b> of all the items in the collection. Each item is displayed with its name, creation date, and an image.<br>
              For every item, two accessible links are provided:
              <ul>
                <li>A link to the item's dedicated page within the chronological narrative, where users can access detailed information about the object.</li>
                <li>A link to the original museum where the item is housed.</li>
              </ul></p>
            <p>
              Navigation through the timeline is intuitive, with arrow buttons allowing users to move to the next or previous item in chronological order. Additionally, a visual timeline at the bottom provides a clear representation of the temporal positioning of the objects and the relative time-spacing between them.<br> 
              The timeline was implemented using <i>KnightLab</i>.
            </p>

            <h3><b>4.2 Color Palette</b></h3>
            <p>The project's visual identity is deeply connected to its central theme: constellations.<br> The two main colors used throughout the website are:
              <ul>
                <li>#F0DAB3 â€“ a soft, warm <b>beige</b></li>
                <li>#8DADC1 â€“ a muted, desaturated <b>blue</b> (used for the navbar and footer)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              These shades are meant to <b>evoke the sky and the stars</b>, but in a subdued, aged tone. This approach not only reinforces the celestial theme but also conveys a <i>vintage aesthetic</i>, aligning with the historical nature of the artifacts and the ancient civilizations they originate from. <br>
              The beige color is used as the primary background for the website, providing a soft, neutral canvas that enhances the visibility of the content and images. The blue color is used for the navbar and footer, to create a subtle contrast and frame the content. <br>
              Both colors are also present inside the cover images chosen for the narratives, as well as from the main visuals featured on the homepage and the header of the documentation page. <br><br>
              <b>Typography & Contrast</b> <br>
              The font color is <b>black</b>, ensuring optimal readability against the lighter backgrounds. <br>
              A neutral <b>gray</b> is used as a background for titles, images, and buttons, creating subtle contrast and emphasizing key elements without overwhelming the design. <br>
              By combining these elements, the color palette achieves a harmonious balance between <i>historical depth and celestial inspiration</i>, enhancing both the navigational clarity and the immersive storytelling of the project.
            </p>
