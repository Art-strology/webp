            <h3 id="exhibition"><b>2.1 Exhibition</b></h3>
            <p>The exhibition offers a multidisciplinary experience that blends ancient art, astrology, and symbolism. Its main goal is to explore how different cultures perceived and interpreted the stars by identifying shapes and symbols. We have selected a series of artifacts from four distinct cultures: Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, and Chinese. Each artifact is linked to the symbolism and mythology associated with constellations. The exhibition aims to create a bridge between these cultures, showing how they viewed the stars, how modern constellations were understood in ancient times, and how these ancient representations continue to influence today's conception of constellations.</p>
            
            <h3 id="objects"><b>2.2 Objects</b></h3>
            <p>Nineteen artifacts from different cultures were selected for the exhibition, with careful attention to their symbolic meanings and connections. All artifacts are well representative of the artstyle and traditions of their country of origin,while also being linked to one another through their associations with the stars.The four cultures featured are Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, and Chinese. Each of this cultures were mastars in the art of astrology. Each of these cultures excelled in the art of astrology: the Babylonians created the earliest known horoscope, the Greeks identified many constellations that are still recognized today, and the Egyptians and Chinese are noted for their unique contributions. A significant effort was put into comparing how these cultures interpreted the constellations and what kind of symbols were associated with them.</p>

            <h3 id="itemsPage"><b>4.1.2 Items Page</b></h3>
            <p>This page allows users to explore the four narrative perspectives: <b>Chronological, Geographical, Constellation, and Symbolic</b>. Given the interwoven nature of these narratives, the primary focus during the development of this page was to ensure a smooth navigation while maintaining clarity. The goal is to always make it clear which narrative the user is currently viewing. <br>
              To achieve this, a header section at the top of the page displays the <i>title</i> and an <i>image</i> corresponding to the active narrative. As users switch between narratives, both the title and image dynamically update, providing a clear visual indicator of their current position. <br>
              At the center of the page, users find: <ul class="list">
              <li>The image of the item, its name, and a table containing key information about the object.</li>
              <li>Three of these details (Geography, Constellation, and Symbol) are clickable links, allowing users to switch to the corresponding narrative.</li>
              <li>The item image itself is interactive: clicking on it opens a lightbox, enabling zoom functionality for a closer look at details.</li>
              <li>A button is available to access the museum map, helping users locate where the item is physically displayed.</li> </ul> <br>
            <p>
              The "Object Description" section provides detailed information, covering: <ol class="list">
              <li>The physical characteristics of the object.</li>
              <li>The history and significance of its constellation.</li>
              <li>Its symbolic meaning in mythology. </li></ol></p>
            <p>
              By default, only a general introductory paragraph is displayed, but users can expand the section to read the full content. <br>
              Finally, at the bottom of the page, <b>narrative cards</b> present alternative pathways to the other three narratives linked to the item. These serve as a secondary navigation method, ensuring that users can easily explore different perspectives, even if they do not initially notice the links within the descriptive table.
            </p>
            <h3 id="collectionPage"><b>4.1.3 Collection Page</b></h3>
            <p>The "Explore the Collections" page organizes artifacts based on their geographical location, ensuring a cohesive and visually harmonious presentation. Each artifact is displayed in an animated card format, with hover effects revealing its name and historical background. Users can click on the cards to access dedicated information pages for a deeper exploration. Additionally, the page features a responsive design, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes for an optimal browsing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The overall aesthetic combines modern web design with historical storytelling, enhancing interactivity and immersion in the exploration process.</p>
            <h3 id="mapPage"><b>4.1.4 Map Page</b></h3>
            <p>The museum map has been designed as a functional and interactive tool, enabling visitors to explore the collection based on their interests and needs. A navigation bar is positioned over the main image to grab the user's attention and provide an easy way to filter the collection by narrative themes. When applicable, sub-narratives appear in a sub-navigation menu, using a lighter color to visually indicate their subordinate relationship to the main navigation. Navigation buttons change color when hovered over or clicked, offering a responsive and interactive experience. <br>
              The map itself is interactive. The areas where items are displayed change color on hover or click, and a popover appears showing the name and an image of the selected item. The popover images are formatted according to the item's structure—horizontal, vertical, or square—to best suit its proportions. The popovers have a white background with black text to enhance readability. <br>
              Numbers are placed next to the items on the map to guide visitors both during their physical visit and while exploring the website, signaling the position of objects within the space. <br>
              A sidebar section containing links to each item's individual page is positioned on the right of the map. This layout ensures that the user's attention is initially drawn to the main image, followed by this section, which provides useful content to enhance the overall experience. The section dynamically updates based on navbar selections, directing users to items relevant to the chosen narrative. Additionally, a button labeled “Explore this narrative!” takes visitors to the first item in a selected narrative, allowing them to view the full list of items in the correct order.
              </p>
            <h3 id="timelinePage"><b>4.1.5 Timeline Page</b></h3>
            <p>The website features an interactive timeline designed to provide a <b>chronological overview</b> of all the items in the collection. Each item is displayed with its name, creation date, and an image.<br>
              For every item, two accessible links are provided:
              <ul class="list">
                <li>A link to the item's dedicated page within the chronological narrative, where users can access detailed information about the object.</li>
                <li>A link to the original museum where the item is housed.</li>
              </ul></p>
            <p>
              Navigation through the timeline is intuitive, with arrow buttons allowing users to move to the next or previous item in chronological order. Additionally, a visual timeline at the bottom provides a clear representation of the temporal positioning of the objects and the relative time-spacing between them.<br> 
              The timeline was implemented using <i>KnightLab</i>.
            </p>

            <h3 id="colorPalette"><b>4.2 Color Palette</b></h3>
            <p>The project's visual identity is deeply connected to its central theme: constellations.<br> The two main colors used throughout the website are:
              <ul class="list">
                <li><span style="background-color:#F0DAB3;">#F0DAB3</span> – a soft, warm <b>beige</b></li>
                <li><span style="background-color:#8DADC1;">#8DADC1</span> – a muted, desaturated <b>blue</b> (used for the navbar and footer)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              These shades are meant to <b>evoke the sky and the stars</b>, but in a subdued, aged tone. This approach not only reinforces the celestial theme but also conveys a <i>vintage aesthetic</i>, aligning with the historical nature of the artifacts and the ancient civilizations they originate from. <br>
              The beige color is used as the primary background for the website, providing a soft, neutral canvas that enhances the visibility of the content and images. The blue color is used for the navbar and footer, to create a subtle contrast and frame the content. <br>
              Both colors are also present inside the cover images chosen for the narratives, as well as from the main visuals featured on the homepage and the header of the documentation page. <br><br>
              
              The font color is <b>black</b>, ensuring optimal readability against the lighter backgrounds. <br>
              A <span style="background-color: #f8f8f8;"><b>neutral light gray</b></span> is used as a background for titles, images, and buttons, creating subtle contrast and emphasizing key elements without overwhelming the design. <br>
              By combining these elements, the color palette achieves a harmonious balance between <i>historical depth and celestial inspiration</i>, enhancing both the navigational clarity and the immersive storytelling of the project.
            </p>

            <h3 id="typography"><b>4.3 Typography</b></h3>
            <p>The website's typography was carefully chosen to ensure clarity and readability. <br>
              <b>Font Choices:</b> <br>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>Headings and titles use <span style="font-family: Crimson Text, serif;"> <b>Crimson Text</b></span>, serif, a typeface that evokes a classic and timeless aesthetic, reinforcing the project's focus on ancient civilizations and historical artifacts.</li>
                <li>Body text, navbar and footer use a sans-serif font, ensuring clean readability.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              The font color is <b>black</b>, providing high contrast against the light beige background for optimal legibility. <b>Bold text</b> is used within the paragraphs that describe the items to emphasize key points, helping users quickly identify the most important information while reading. <br>
              This typography selection balances modern usability with a historical touch, aligning with the vintage-inspired color palette.
              By combining these elements, the typography supports the narrative-driven structure of the website while maintaining a harmonious and visually engaging design.

        <!-- 6) Workflow -->
        <section>
          <h2 id="workflow">6. Workflow</h2>
          <p>After our team identified a shared interest in constellations, we decided to create a project focusing on artifacts related to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and China. We studied examples from prominent museums like the Louvre, Victoria and Albert, and the British Museum to understand their online presentations and design strategies.</p><p>Our process included both collecting relevant artifacts and evaluating digital museum platforms to identify the most engaging and user-friendly design approaches. We settled on a curation strategy involving storytelling through chronological, geographical, shape-based, and constellation-related perspectives.</p><p> This multi-layered approach helps highlight the intricate connections between mythology, astrology, and art. To facilitate exploration, we incorporated interactive features such as a dynamic timeline and a geographical map.
            The "Timeline" page allows users to view historical artifacts in sequence, offering insight into the evolution of cultural and scientific perspectives across time. The interactive museum map helps visitors navigate the exhibits, displaying the spatial distribution of artifacts, and enabling users to learn about each item through its context within a specific geographical location, time period, and symbolic meaning. Each artifact’s detailed page is organized in a structured format with key information, including cultural significance, materials, date, and associated constellations or symbols. The layout allows users to click on specific aspects of an artifact to shift between narratives, enhancing their experience.</p>
           <p>At the same time we also developed a collection page, which organizes items based on their geographical location. This provides a visually harmonious presentation, showcasing artifacts in related groups. Each artifact is presented in an animated card format, with hover effects revealing its name and historical context. Users can click on each card to be directed to its dedicated information page.</p> <p>Finally, the main page serves as the central hub, unifying all aspects of the project into an easy-to-navigate layout. The navigation bar ensures smooth transitions between the various pages, offering quick access to the timeline, museum map, artifact collection, and detailed item pages. The integrated design encourages visitors to explore the artifacts from different perspectives—geographically, chronologically, symbolically, and through the lens of constellations—allowing for an immersive experience. The seamless interaction between dynamic elements ensures that users engage deeply with the historical and cultural narratives behind each exhibit.</p>
