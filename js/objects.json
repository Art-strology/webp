          "This finely crafted palette, made of greywacke, features a rare depiction of a pair of mud turtles <i>(Trionyx triunguis)</i>, a species native to the Nile River and its canals. The imagery of two turtles is thought to symbolize <b>fertility and regeneration</b>, connecting the palette to significant cultural and spiritual concepts of the time. During the Pharaonic Period, turtles held a dual symbolic role. They were associated with <b>chaos and disorder</b> but could also serve as powerful amulets, harnessing their perceived negative traits for <b>protective purposes</b>. <br> Given that this palette was likely used to grind pigments for eye paint, this connection becomes even more fitting. In ancient Egypt, eye paint was not merely decorative but also served protective functions, shielding the wearer from infection, sunlight and malevolent forces. A unique Egyptian palette featuring a pair of Nile mud turtles, Trionyx triunguis, symbolizing fertility and regeneration."

        "longerInfo": [
          "According to Egyptian astronomical diagrams, the constellation of the two turtles is located to the east of the star Sirius, in the <b>constellations of Leo</b>. This celestial placement held great significance, as the turtles were associated with the cycles of the Nile and the cosmos. During the winter solstice, the constellation of the two turtles would set in the west, the realm of the dead, as the sun rose in the east. This phenomenon symbolized the triumph of light, embodied by the sun <i>god Ra</i>, over darkness and disorder."
        ],

        "fullInfo": "In Egyptian mythology, the turtle was an ambiguous creature. It was both a symbol of evil and chaos, as well as a potent protective force. The Nile turtle, known as <i>Styw</i> or “the mysterious one,” could live hidden in the mud and remain underwater for extended periods, characteristics that inspired its association with both mystery and malevolence. The turtle was considered an enemy of Ra, capable of hindering his journey through the underworld. Inside the chapter 161 of “The Book of the Dead”, an ancient Egyptian funerary text, there is a spell that says “May Ra live, and the turtle die”, reflecting the eternal battle between light and darkness. This statement celebrates Ra’s triumph as the guardian of cosmic order over the forces of chaos embodied by the turtle. However, the turtle’s role also include benevolent aspects, representing the life-giving floods of the Nile and the balance between chaos and order.  This duality illustrates its complex place in Egyptian spirituality. ",
