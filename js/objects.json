          "This finely crafted palette, made of greywacke, features a rare depiction of a pair of mud turtles <i>(Trionyx triunguis)</i>, a species native to the Nile River and its canals. The imagery of two turtles is thought to symbolize <b>fertility and regeneration</b>, connecting the palette to significant cultural and spiritual concepts of the time. During the Pharaonic Period, turtles held a dual symbolic role. They were associated with <b>chaos and disorder</b> but could also serve as powerful amulets, harnessing their perceived negative traits for <b>protective purposes</b>. <br> Given that this palette was likely used to grind pigments for eye paint, this connection becomes even more fitting. In ancient Egypt, eye paint was not merely decorative but also served protective functions, shielding the wearer from infection, sunlight and malevolent forces. A unique Egyptian palette featuring a pair of Nile mud turtles, Trionyx triunguis, symbolizing fertility and regeneration."

          "According to Egyptian astronomical diagrams, the constellation of the two turtles is located to the east of the star Sirius, in the <b>constellations of Leo</b>. This celestial placement held great significance, as the turtles were associated with the cycles of the Nile and the cosmos. During the winter solstice, the constellation of the two turtles would set in the west, the realm of the dead, as the sun rose in the east. This phenomenon symbolized the triumph of light, embodied by the sun <i>god Ra</i>, over darkness and disorder."
        ],

        "fullInfo": "In Egyptian mythology, the turtle was an ambiguous creature. It was both a symbol of evil and chaos, as well as a potent protective force. The Nile turtle, known as <i>Styw</i> or “the mysterious one,” could live hidden in the mud and remain underwater for extended periods, characteristics that inspired its association with both mystery and malevolence. The turtle was considered an enemy of Ra, capable of hindering his journey through the underworld. Inside the chapter 161 of “The Book of the Dead”, an ancient Egyptian funerary text, there is a spell that says “May Ra live, and the turtle die”, reflecting the eternal battle between light and darkness. This statement celebrates Ra’s triumph as the guardian of cosmic order over the forces of chaos embodied by the turtle. However, the turtle’s role also include benevolent aspects, representing the life-giving floods of the Nile and the balance between chaos and order.  This duality illustrates its complex place in Egyptian spirituality. ",

        "fullInfo": "In ancient Greek mythology, <b>dragons were often depicted as serpentine creatures</b> due to a blend of symbolic and narrative reasons. <b>Snakes symbolized power, danger, and the forces of nature</b>, making them a fitting representation for dragons, who were typically guardians of treasures or sacred places. <br>Ancient greeks associated the <b>Draco</b> constellation with <b>several mithological dragons</b>. In Catasterismi, attributed to Eratosthenes, Draco is identified with <b>Ladon</b>, the dragon that guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides. When <b>Herakles was tasked with stealing the apples as part of his Twelve Labors</b>, he killed Ladon, and the goddess <b>Hera transformed the dragon into a constellation</b> to immortalize it. In the sky, Herakles is often depicted with one foot on the head of Draco, symbolizing his victory over the creature. <br>According to Gaius Julius Hyginus in De Astronomica, <b>Draco was one of the Gigantes</b>, the giants who fought the Olympian gods in the Gigantomachy. The goddess <b>Athena killed this dragon and hurled its body into the sky</b>, where it became twisted in the celestial pole, frozen in place before it could right itself. Aelius Aristides, another ancient writer, referred to the dragon as Aster or Asterius and mentioned that Athens celebrated Athena's victory over the dragon during the Great Panathenaea festival, which coincided with the culmination of Draco’s head as seen from the Athenian Acropolis.",

In another version, told by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses, Perseus killed the monster with his diamond sword.
